# Kovai Kural - Frontend (React + Vite)


## Quick start
1. Create project folder `frontend` and copy files accordingly (or clone this canvas's file contents).
2. Install dependencies:


```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```


3. Start dev server:


```bash
npm run dev
```


4. Environment
- By default the app requests API at `http://localhost:5000/api`.
- You can set `VITE_API_BASE` in an `.env` in frontend root, e.g. `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000`.


Enjoy!
